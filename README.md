# Project Title
Project 1


## Motivation

We were required to create an online app that uses two APIs and a front-end framework other than Bootstrap for our Carleton Univerity bootcamp program.  We decided on an app that would allow a user to enter a word, find its definition, identify synonyms and antonyms for the word, and show a related words bubble diagram.

6. Read the antonyms.  <!-- As a stretch goal (beyond MVP)... If there is a word you would like to search, click on that word  -->
7. View the related words bubble diagram.    <!-- As a stretch goal (beyond MVP)... If there is a word you would like to search, click on that word  -->
